# ECSv8 - Character ID Randomizer

ECSv8 simple tool for choosing an ID for an Extra Character, ignoring those already registered.

## How do I add my ID?

To add your characters' IDs to the ignore list, you need to follow 3 simple steps:

1. Register on github.com if you haven't already. Make a fork of this repository.
2. Open the file `js/ids.js`, and add your IDs to the `registeredID` array.
    - Note: Add your IDs to the end of an existing line with commas where necessary. Do not touch or change the IDs that have already been.
3. Save your changes and send a pull request with indicating the mod's link to your Extra Character so that we can know for sure that this ID is now being used.

Well done! Now the IDs you have added will be marked as used, and will not be found as suggested IDs for other people.
